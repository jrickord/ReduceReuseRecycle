# Reduce Reuse Recycle
Using Linear Regression and Correlation Analysis to identify the best solution to Reducing COVID Cases

Handled missing data with static and dynamic solutions to fill in gaps in dataset as well as prior EDA. Compiled data from multiple different data sources of various formats into normalized dataset. Ran simple visual analysis to identify correlations, then advanced our analysis techniques leveraging Pearson correlation values to identify most weak correlations for the purpose of feature reduction. Once dataset was consolidated correctly, linear regression models were used to identify that state restrictions were the strongest indicators for infected population numbers.
